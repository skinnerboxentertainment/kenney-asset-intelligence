# Desktop launcher

Double-click **Kenney Asset Index** on the desktop. It starts the server if it
is not already running, waits for it to answer, and opens the browser. No
console window appears.

| file | what it is |
|------|------------|
| `Kenney Asset Index.vbs` | hidden-window wrapper; the shortcut targets this |
| `launch.mjs` | finds a port, starts the server, waits, opens the browser |
| `make-icon.mjs` | builds `kenney-assets.ico` from an asset in the library |
| `install-shortcut.ps1` | (re)creates the desktop shortcut |
| `server.log` | last run's server output; read this if it fails to open |

Re-create the shortcut after moving the repo:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\install-shortcut.ps1
```

## Notes

**Port.** Defaults to 7823, falling back to 7824-7826. It is not 5173 because
something else on this machine already uses that. Override with `KENNEY_PORT`.

**Identity, not liveness.** A port is only treated as "already ours" when
`/api/stats` answers with this app's JSON. An earlier version checked only
whether *something* answered, found an unrelated dev server on 5173, and would
have opened the browser onto the wrong app.

**Both loopback stacks.** Vite binds `::1`, not `127.0.0.1`. Probing or
binding a single hardcoded loopback address disagrees with reality -- a
127.0.0.1 probe finds nothing while a 127.0.0.1 bind succeeds, so the launcher
concluded both "not running" and "port is free" about a port that was neither,
then died with `Port 7823 is already in use`. Both `::1` and `127.0.0.1` are
now checked, and a port counts as free only when every one of them is.

**Stopping it.** The server keeps running in the background until you log out.
To stop it sooner, end the `node.exe` task whose command line mentions `vite`,
or just leave it -- it is idle when nothing is using it.

**Failures are visible.** If dependencies are missing or the server does not
come up in 90 seconds, a dialog explains why rather than the icon appearing to
do nothing.
